# StarryPy3k

##About
StarryPy3k is the successor to StarryPy. StarryPy is a plugin-drived Starbound server wrapper that adds a great deal of functionality to Starbound. StarryPy3k is written using asyncio is Python 3.

***Please note this is still in very active development and is not ready to be used on general purpose servers. It should mostly work, but you have been forewarned.***

## Requirements
Python 3.3 or greater is required.
If using Python 3.4, there are no requirements. In Python 3.3 asyncio, pathlib, and enum34 are all required.

## Installation
If you are installing during the development phase, please clone the repository with git. It is recommended to install [Python 3.4](http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/) instead of Python 3.3; all pushes are tested against 3.4 but not 3.3.

## Contributing
As we gear up for a more general-purpose release, there is a great need for documentation, particularly in the plugins. If you wish to contribute to the docs, please use a sphinx format.

In addition, plugin development is encouraged. There are still a few features missing from the core (particularly in the role system). A more comprehensive guide on plugin development is in the works. Please not that plugins will not work without modification from the original version of StarryPy.

If you would like to talk with other contributors/ask questions about development, please join ##StarryPy on irc.freenode.net.
